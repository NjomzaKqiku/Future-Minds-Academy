<body> <h1>Njomza Kqiku</h1>
    Hi reader! Here are some interesting facts about me.
    I'm Njomza, a <b>Kosova</b>  citizen, born and raised in my country.
    I'm <i>24 years old</i> and a <i>graduated nurse</i>. I love my profession as a nurse, or the fact that i get to save lives, but I'm also interested to learn coding and maybe shift my career.
    I'm a wife and also a mom. I bring new lives to world, but that is not my only goal! I aspire to become someone that brings new innovations to the world (or at least try to).
    Recently i got into a coding course, hoping to become a web developer!
    I have a lot of hobbies, one of them being <i>cuissine</i>. I love cooking and baking (and i think im good at it lol).
    <b>If you find me interesting or want to become friends</b> feel free to add me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/njomzemuji/" target="_blank"><b>Facebook</b></a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/njomza._m/" target="_blank"><b>Instagram</b></a>. 
    It would be a pleasure to make new friends and maybe future colleagues!
    However, besides making new friends I hope i will gain a lot more from the course.
    Here are some of my near future goals
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Becoming a web developer</b></li>
        <li> <b>Manage my time better</b></li>
        <li> <b>Travel more</b></li>
        <li> <b>Visit my parents</b></li>
        <li> <b>Perform Umrah</b></li>
    </ul>
    Did i mention that I'm a comedy movie and animated movie fan?
    Well here are my top favorite movies:
    <ol>
        <li><b>Deliha</b></li>
        <li><b>Frozen</b></li>
        <li><b>The Grinch</b></li>
