    <h1>Njomza Kqiku</h1>
    <p>Hi reader! I'm Njomza, a <b>Kosova</b> citizen, born and raised in my
        country.
        I'm <i>24 years old</i> and a <i>graduated nurse</i>. I love my profession as a nurse,
        but I'm also interested to learn coding and maybe shift my career.
        I have a lot of hobbies, one of them being <i>cuissine</i>. I love cooking and baking (and i think im good at it
        lol).
        I also have a small business about arts and crafts called
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mandryshe_/" target="_blank"><b><em>Ma Ndryshe</em></b></a>.
        Recently i got into a coding course, hoping to become a web developer!
        <b>If you find me interesting or want to become friends</b> feel free to add me
        on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/njomzemuji/" target="_blank"><b>Facebook</b></a>
        or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/njomza._m/" target="_blank"><b>Instagram</b></a>.
        It would be a pleasure to make new friends and maybe future colleagues!
        However, besides making new friends I hope i will gain a lot more from the course.
